## Abstract

This repository provides a concise overview of working with the [HMEQ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajay1735/hmeq-data) to predict loan defaults and estimate loss amounts when defaults occur. The process includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model comparisons using various techniques, including tree models, linear models with different variable selection methods, and neural networks. Each section is covered in separate scripts for easy reference.
